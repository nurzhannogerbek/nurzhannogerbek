✌️ Hello, friend! I am glad to see you on my personal GitHub profile. My name is `Nurzhan`.

🏠 I am living in `Almaty` 🍎 and I am from `Kazakhstan` 🇰🇿.

👦🏻 Since I first wrote my first piece of code in `Turbo Pascal` as a child using my father's personal computer in `Windows 95`, software development has become my passion.

⏱ I still live with this passion in the commercial software development industry, where I have been working for `5+` years.

🏢 I started my career from developing multi-user web applications for the outsourcing company `Rubius` in 2015.

🏦 Then I worked for 1.5 years in the `Kazakhstan Stock Exchange` in FinTech projects. During this short time, I managed to develop `4` financial and analytical web projects for the company.

📡 I worked for the largest telecommunications company in Central Asia from 2018 to 2020. I am proud to have participated in the creation of `7` scalable distributed Big Data systems in a microservice architecture at `VEON` company.

🚀 Since the fall of 2020, I have been involved in the development of a fast-growing and promising startup at `SmartLab` company.

🛠 I usually use `Golang` for `Backend Development`, `JavaScript` for `Frontend Development`, `Scala` for `Data Engineering`, and `Python` for `Data Science`.

📚 I have a `Master's Degree` in `Computer Science` from `Tomsk Polytechnic University` in Russia.

🤖 I have implemented `15+` successful web projects that have made life easier for thousands of users. You can easily find details of these projects in my GitHub profile.

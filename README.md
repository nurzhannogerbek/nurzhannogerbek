✌🏻 Hello, my friend! I am glad to see you on my personal GitHub profile. My name is Nurzhan.

⏱ My passion for software development ignited when I crafted my very first piece of code using the Turbo Pascal programming language on my father's personal computer as a child. This zeal for coding has not only persisted but has flourished over the years. Now, with more than 8 years of experience in the IT industry, I continue to embrace this passion daily.

I have also made significant contributions to the FinTech sector, developing solutions that streamline financial transactions and data analytics. My versatility in the IT field is further highlighted by my engagement with AI development, pushing the boundaries of machine learning and intelligent automation across various applications.

🛠 I usually use Golang for Backend Development, JavaScript for Frontend Development, Scala for Data Engineering, and Python for Data Science.

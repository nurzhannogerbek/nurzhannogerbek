✌🏻 Hello, my friend! I am glad to see you on my personal `GitHub` repository. My name is `Nurzhan`.

🐎 I am a `Digital Nomad` who is ready to work remotely from anywhere in the world.

⏱ Software development has become my passion since I first wrote my first piece of code in the `Turbo Pascal` programming language as a child, using my father's personal computer. I still live with this passion and already have `7+` years of development experience in the IT industry.

🏢 I started my professional career by developing a multi-user web application for the outsourcing company `Rubius` in `2015`.

🏦 Then I worked for `1.5` years at the `Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE)` on `FinTech` projects. I managed to develop `4` financial and analytical web projects for `KASE` during this time.

📡 I am proud that I worked for one of the largest telecommunications companies in Central Asia during the period from `2018` to `2020`. `VEON` management entrusted me with the creation of scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed `Big Data` systems in a microservice architecture in `7` different projects.

🚀 I am passionate about the `AWS` ecosystem. My deep dive into the details of its cloud products began in the fall of `2020` when I was invited to develop a `SaaS` platform from scratch at the `SmartLab` company. The result of my work was the sale of the startup I was working on to the largest Asian telecommunication company.

🛠 I usually use `Golang` for `Backend Development`, `JavaScript` for `Frontend Development`, `Scala` for `Data Engineering`, and `Python` for `Data Science`.

📚 I have a `Master's Degree` in `Information Systems and Technologies` from `Tomsk Polytechnic University`.

🤖 I have experience working in startups and big companies. I have implemented dozens of successful projects that have made life easier for thousands of users. You can easily find details of some of these projects on my `GitHub` repository.

📩 Feel free to contact me with your ideas and suggestions!
